// UI MVP:
// 1. Find the point of intersection between ray and the first 3D geometric structure
// 2. Identify the object and its relation to OSM data structure
// 2a. Starting with roads
// 3. If data is available, display it on the screen
// 3a. Display road information: starting with the name of the road
// 4. Display the information in a pop-up window
//
// Widget capabilities for MVP:
// - Show text with a single font and single size
// - Make the the pop up be movable (in the long term by the user or depend on the mouse position)
// - The pop up should dynamically resize based on the content but it should also be possible for
// -    - the text to wrap at the max width
//
// Questions: What role does the viewport play in the UI? Should multiple be used?
// viewports be used?
