# About

The application is currently capable of showing a 3D visualization of a patch of land  with information provided by the Overpass API (readonly API for OpenStreetMap data).
In the future the application should be able to show more detailed 3D geometry and allow for simulation to be plugged in and affect the movement of 3D objects.
