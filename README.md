# Things to do:

* Move vulkan helpers to lib_wrappers and refactor to function as a wrapper
* explore dynamic renderpasses in vulkan to simplify rendering
* Change C namespacing to C++ namespacing
* remove snake case naming to pascal case for function along the way
* Reconsider global state for http, tctx, etc.
