# Problems:
* Sometimes the wrong texture is used on objects, which is a problem with the loading use of textures in the asset manager.

# Things to do:

* Asset Store is currently not thread safe for eviction cases and memory needs to be managed properly.
  * When asset getting evicted we have to make sure no other threads are using the resource.
* Find way to flush logs so the memory does not build up forever
* Threads in asset store should manage have more than one available command buffer in the thread command pool.
* Linux support:
  * entrypoint caller currently implemented for windows should change to linux.
  * HTTP client implementation improvements on linux (move away from httplib)
  * hot reloading refactor to simplify the implementation for linux
  * Base library fixes
* Create method for logging


# On Linux
* For Khronos validation layer support (enabled if DEBUG_BUILD macro is defined) remember to install it:
  * sudo apt install vulkan-validationlayers (Ubuntu)
* Compiling (incl. linking) takes a very long time at the moment.
* hotreloading does not work at the moment, due to the entrypoint library not being unloaded using dlclose
  * This has been a problem defining TRACY_ENABLE in the past as the library overwrites dlclose. This is however not the current problem
* remember to link crypto and ssl libraries when using https and define the macro CPPHTTPLIB_OPENSSL_SUPPORT in httplib

Use the ktx tool from khronos group. Example with mip map generation:
ktx create --format R8G8B8A8_SRGB --generate-mipmap brick_wall.jpg brick_wall.ktx2
